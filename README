R# MongoDB driver using the Mongo C++ client library.
Library is really in its gamma 0.001 stage, but it will
mature over time. 

There is already effort to build R driver for MongoDB, but
it uses Scala and have bindings to Java.

ps. Why R#, not R. Right - in the search engine era
the R is propably the worst name for programming language.
So I am using R# for better searchability.
